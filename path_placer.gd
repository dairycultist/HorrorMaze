extends Node

#horror game where you search the dark corridors of a randomly generated maze (made with randomized depth-first search) while keeping an inconsistent weeping angel at bay (it makes offputting sounds)
#need , I L T and X rooms (with rotations)
#and pathfinding, but that's just putting a node inside every room

#nah 3D maze. you're underground and you find a big metal cube
#emerge from cramped metal corridors to slightly less cramped stone ones
#maybe it'd be smarter to make this wall-based meshing instead of room-based
#plus allows for some large rooms
